// This project was definitely more difficult than Deques and Qeues, maybe same level as Percolation. At first, I wasn't sure on how to approach this. 
// After planning out the main algorithms, especially for Fast Collinear, it became much more clear to me and the initial code writing process was quite fast.
// Point.java was easy, Brute Collinear was okay. Fast Collinear was hard. I ensured that each main method accounted for bounds and threw exception errors when the bounds were crossed
// The real struggle was refining my code again and again for the coursera auto grader. I forgot that duplicate lines were possible, so I accounted for that by sorting my line segment lists in
// acending order then comparing the first value of the list. I experienced a timing issue in coursera, but I figured this was the best I could do.
